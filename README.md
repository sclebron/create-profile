#create-profile

##Description

This is the start of creating my own webpage to showcase my portfolio. I currently don't have any applications that I have created to add to my portfolio, so I have some filler images and webpages to have temporarily until I have my own applications to add. As this class progresses, and I create my own applications, I will go back and replace the fillers with my own work. I will also spend more time working on the design of my website to create a more visually appealing website.
